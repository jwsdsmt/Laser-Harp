# Laser-Harp
Pluck a laser beam to play a harpstring!

Well, not really. For one, it's a laser: you can't pluck it. For another, you don't pluck it, because the note sustains for as long as the beam is broken. For a third, plucking the laser doesn't play a note. Instead, the project uses time of flight sensors to determine when a hand is plucking the laser beam, and then plays a note.
